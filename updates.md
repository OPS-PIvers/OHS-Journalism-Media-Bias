# The "XP" Scoring System -- Reward students for finding diverse content, not just what’s easy to find.

## +10 XP: Standard Discovery (finding an article)
-- Auto-approved by default
-- Students still select in the grid/chart where the bias is
-- Teacher no longer has to approve (or label the bias on the chart to confirm)
   
## BONUS: +10 XP: Recognize the bias and support your response (finding a source in the extreme bottom-left or bottom-right).
    --> Upon submission, the teacher gets a highly professionally styled email with the information from the students submission adn there is a button to approve and a button to deny directly in the email so they don't have to go into the web app.

# Make the X/Y axes lighter along with their labels so it's easier to see.

# add the scale numbers on the x and y axis edges so kids can be more precise when rating articles
